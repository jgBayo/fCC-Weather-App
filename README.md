# fCC-Weather-App
This is the weather app project within the Intermediate Front-End Projects in the freeCodeCamp Front-End certificate

The app contacts the freeCodeCamp weather API after looking at the user's current position. It then displays the different local weather data such as temperature, pressure and a general weather description. Temperature can be changed from Celsius to Fahrenheit degrees.
